# Bootstrapping-Estimators-based-on-the-Block-Maxima-Method

This repository contains the code used to generate the simulation and case studies of the paper: BÃ¼cher, Staud (2024): Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method.

The structure is as follows:

-   **src**: Contains both the R- and Rcpp source code for the simulation study

-   **data**: Contains data generated by scripts of processing nature. **Attention**: raw data generated by the HPC is not uploaded as it would exceed the data storage capacity.

-   **results**: Contains the various plots produced.

-   **scripts**: Contains the various scripts used to generate/process data and plots.

    -   subfolders indicate simulation sub-studies which needed computational power aided by a High Performance Cluster (HPC) (provided by *ZIM: Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf*; for which we are grateful)
